# UK Birds Anki deck

Use this code to generate an [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) deck of UK birds.  Uses data from the RSPB website.

This deck is hosted on AnkiWeb at [this link](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/48784066).  Install it there like any other Anki deck.

To generate from source: run `rspb.py` to generate a csv file and images folder, which can then both be imported into Anki.
